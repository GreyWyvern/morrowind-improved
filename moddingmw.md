## FOLLOWING MODDING MORROWIND

### BEGINNING WITH MENDING MORROWIND

Modding Morrowind is a follow up guide to [**Mending Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendingmw.md). Whereas Modding Morrowind is about installing mods that expand on the original game, Mending Morrowind has all the pre-requisites needed to enjoy a stable and mostly bug-free Morrowind experience. Because of this, Modding Morrowind assumes you have already followed through with Mending Morrowind.

### CREATING SEPARATORS IN MOD ORGANIZER 2

Separators allow you to neatly separate installed mods in Mod Organizer 2 for ease of viewing. I recommend creating a separator for the following sections before installing these mods.

- Right click on the empty space on the mod order window, and click **Create Separator**.
- Name it accordingly to its category and click **OK**.

### INSTALLING THE MODULES

As explained in the main page, this guide is modular, and each module can be installed independent from each other. That said, for the sake of simplicity these are the steps you should following when installing any of these modules.

- Install a given module.
- Clean whatever dirty plugins it may have, as per their corresponding **Cleaning plugins** section.
- Jump into the **Finishing touches** section, which will contain the most general information.

Always remember that though these modules are independent from each other, they work with minimum conflicts if you install them in order, and if you install their respective mods in order as well. This doesn't mean you can't install modules and mods out of order, as Mod Organizer 2 lets us rearrange mod and plugin order after installing them. It just means following this guide in order will be your best bet at preserving your sanity.

Good luck!

## USER INTERFACE

These mods expand on the readibility and functionality of Morrowind's user interface. They don't really alter how the game plays but how more useful the user interface is.

This mod adds black bars on both sides of the splash screens and the main menu so that they will no longer be stretched when playing in widescreen resolutions. It also includes the six missing Bethesda splash screens.

## CONTENT RESTORATION

These mods restored content cut from the finished game. There's an emphasis on mod that took the shortest route to restore this cut content, and most importantly, on cut content that works well.

## INTERNAL LOGIC

These mods increase the internal consistency of the game, taking into account aspects such as lore and dialogue.

- [**Blighted Mine Means Blighted Workers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/33920) by Cliffworms: if a mine is blighted, the kwama worker standing outside of it will now be blighted as well.
- [**Corprus Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45544) by grasscid: gives you the disease resisting effects of Corprus as soon as you catch it from Dagoth Gares rather than after Divayth Fyr cures you, as according to the lore.
- [**Dubdilla Location Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46720) by half11: moves the entrance to the cavern of Dubdilla to a more logical place according to in-game information.

- [**FMI - Legion Dialogue**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47318) by PoodleSandwich: fixes several inconsistencies in dialogue spoken by members of the Imperial Legion.
- [**FMI - Misc**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47637) by PoodleSandwich: fixes a handful of small inconsistencies between lore and what is found in game.
  - Install both main files.

- [**FMI - NotAllDunmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47569) by PoodleSandwich: not all Dunmer are slavers. Not all Argonians are slaves. Idle dialogue filtering has been improved to reflect this. 
- [**FMI - Service Refusal and Contraband**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47456) by PoodleSandwich: fixes lore to gameplay inconsistencies pertaining to contraband items and service refusal. 
- [**LDM - Context Matters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48273) by Lucevar: edits, re-filters, or adds on to vanilla dialogue to add more situational nuance - tavern owners will no longer talk about themselves in third person, Ashlanders will no longer curse vampires in the name of Almsivi, slave owners won't talk lovingly about abolitionists, and thieves will be less blase about incriminating themselves to strangers.
- [**Ownership Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48051) by Necrolesian: assigns ownership to the many, many items and containers that rightly should be owned but weren't, and otherwise makes adjustments to item ownership.

- [**Synthesis Series - Creatures and Diseases**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48279) by Half11: edits existing creatures and adds new creature variants according to in-game lore, restoring unused diseases into the game.
- [**Telvanni Staff for the Telvanni Staff**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47869/) by Gavrilo93: according to in-game information, it seems that a Telvanni Mouth's symbol of office is the Silver Staff of Peace. Yet in vanilla, only you get one when you become a Mouth, which you would have to give to Fast Eddie when he becomes your Mouth. Therefore this mod adds a Silver Staff of Peace into the inventory of the six other Telvanni Mouths, including Baladas' Mouth, who only shows up mid-game.
- [**Temples with Shrines**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45535) by Leyawynn: adds shrines to the temples in Maar Gan, Molag Mar, Suran and Vos.
- [**The Dream is the Door**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47423) by Melchior Dahrk: to align with what the in-game dialogue suggests, the entrance to the Cavern of the Incarnate will now only be visible during the magical hours of twilight. 
- [**The Madstone**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47653) by Melchior Dahrk: makes the Madstone work as described on the lore, adds a new model to the Madstone, and expands on in-game dialogue.

## VISUALS

These mods aim to improve specific visual aspects of the game I personally found deficient, especially when the game is paired alongside MGE XE in the case of water sources. This section also includes mods to make interiors and nights darker, and add groundcover to most of Morrowind's regions. Other little mods included tweak certain silly-looking meshes, or add neat visual effects to some of the game's statics.

  - Download the mod from the main link at the top of the page, *not* the outdated v1.0 link at the bottom.
- [**correctUV Diverse Ore Veins**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-42-13484) by CJW-Craigor and Nich: matches the ore container textures to the caves the containers are placed in, with better UV mapping by Nich.

- [**Mist Retexture**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44322) by Remiros: improves the texture for the mist. The mist is now much smoother and more detailed, as well as less opaque and flat. This also makes it play much nicer with SSAO.

- [**R-Zero's Throbbing Meat - a Corprus Meat Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45339) by R-Zero: replaces corprus meat models with animated, twitching ones ones.
  - MO2 will tell you there's no game data on top level. 
    - Right click **Data Files** and click **Set data directory**. Untick the **Textures** folder. Click **OK**.
- [**Signs-Banners Tweak Edit**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/gsoqn3n2za8c5it/Signs-Banners_Tweak_Edit.zip/file) by ddfields and Sigourn: corrects the UV Set TexCoord so that signs will display the same on both sides.

  - Only install the **Gold coins** main file.

- [**Transporter Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48050) by Eq: Caravaners, Gondoliers, and Shipmasters equip lights at night for more immersion.
- [**Unto Dust**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48435?) by Melchior Dahrk and Greatness7: adds floating dust to areas where dead are entombed similar to what is seen in Skyrim barrows.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:
    - **00 Core**
    - **01 Default Dust**
- [**Visually Filled Soul Gems**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46709) by NullCascade: makes in-world soul gems that are filled appear as enchanted items.

- [**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816) by Hrnchamd: regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions.
  - This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.
- [**Weather Adjuster - Morrowind Improved json**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/r7vlwhoko8rg2co/Weather_Adjuster_-_Sigourn%2527s_Mod_List_json.zip/file) by Sigourn: personal preset for darker nights and less horrible fog.

  - [**Comparison here.**](https://imgsli.com/MTUwMjI)
- [**Well Diversified**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7fv2wojbp6y3uo9/AABIH_hMYjbqmZCPBnyu4NPqa?dl=0&preview=Well+Diversified.7z) by Slartibartfast: creates variants of the well mesh to better fit Imperial and Solstheim architecture.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged.
    - Create a folder called **Meshes** in the mod's root directory in Mod Organizer 2.
    - Drag the **x** folder into the **Meshes** folder.
- [**Wolf Helmet Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/29281) by Alaisiagae: replaces the Wolf and Snow Wolf Helmets with a ferocious wolf head with gaping jaws.

### READABLE SIGNPOSTS

Choose between one of these two alternatives for readable signposts. My personal preference is PeterBitt's, but if you are a vanilla purist nothing beats Atrayonis'.

- [**Near Vanilla Road Sign Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44957?) by Atrayonis: makes road signs legible. Uses vanilla background and resolution.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:
    - **00 Core**
    - **01 Vvardenfell only**
- [**Signposts Retextured**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42126?) by PeterBitt: makes road signs legible. Uses higher quality vanilla-friendly textures.
  - Install only one of the main files.

### LESS INTRUSIVE MAGIC GLOW

Choose between one of these two alternatives for less intrusive magic glow. My personal preference is Assetless No Glow, but if you are a vanilla purist nothing beats Subtle Magic Glow.

- [**Subtle Magic Glow**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/4468?) by atteSmythe: replaces the "plastic wrap" effect around in-game magic items (those equipped by characters or on the ground) with less-obtrusive versions.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick **faint** and click **OK**.
- [**Assetless No Glow**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47925/) by NullCascade: removes the "plastic wrap" effect around in-game magic items (those equipped by characters or on the ground). Uses less memory and is more compatible than other "no plastic wrap effect" mods.
  - For **Weapon Sheathing** to not add the glow effect back into sheathed equipment, we will need to comment some lines in **Weapon Sheating\MWSE\mods\weaponSheathing\main.lua**. We must add "-- " in front of these three lines, as seen here:
    - -- tes3.worldController:applyEnchantEffect(visual, quiver.enchantment)
    - -- tes3.worldController:applyEnchantEffect(visual, shield.enchantment)
    - -- tes3.worldController:applyEnchantEffect(visual, weapon.enchantment)
  - This will allow **Weapon Sheathing** to work flawlessly with **Assetless No Glow**.
  
### MGE XE MODS

The following mods require additional MGE XE configuration after installation to work as intended. Read the mod pages carefully.

- [**Remiros' Groundcover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46733) by Remiros, vtastek, and Hrnchamd: adds groundcover to almost all regions.
  - Only install the **Remiros' Groundcover** main file.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:

- [**Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105) by Greatness7, R-Zero, and vtastek: adds recurring earthquakes to certain volcanically active regions of Vvardenfell. The quakes are implemented strictly for atmospheric purposes and should not directly affect gameplay or conflict with any other mods.
  - MO2 will tell you there's no game data on top level. 
    - Right click **Data Files** and click **Set data directory**. Click **OK**.

## AUDIO

These mods don't so much replace existent sound effects, but like the Visuals section, they seek to improve on the game by adding neat sound effects where there previously weren't any. Overall, most of these tend to improve immersion.

- [**Outdoor Banners With Sound**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by Half11: outdoor banners now play sound alongside their animations. During clear weather types the unused flag.wav sound file is used (it fits this weather type better compared to the standard flag2.wav). For stormy weather types the script uses the regular flag2.wav sound file.
- [**Sheep-no-More**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45168) by McChuggernaut: removes the sheep sounds from Morrowind.
- [**Shut the Fuck up Cliff Racers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46588) by Merlord: drastically reduces the frequency of idle Cliff Racer screeches, by editing the kf file of the cliff racer mesh.

- [**Sounds of Souls**](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods/) by NullCascade: soul gems in the world, in the player's inventory, and that the player interacts with will play sounds, corresponding to the creature trapped inside of it.
  - To download the file from GitHub you need to click on the **Clone or download** button on the upper right and click **Download Zip**.
  - MO2 will tell you there's no game data on top level.
    - Expand the **morrowind-mods-master** folder. 
    - Right click **Sounds of Souls** and click **Set data directory**.
    - Rename the mod to **Sounds of Souls**. Click **OK**.

- [**Water Sounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47794) by abot: simulates water sounds when colliding with generic fake animated water meshes.

## OVERHAULS

These mods make changes to many different game locations with the intention to make them stand out or feel more adequate to what they are supposed to be. These are not your average "clutter" mods, but mods which thoughtfully improve the locations they overhaul.

- [**Atmospheric Delights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47472) by Lucevar: interior overhaul of Desele's House of Earthly Delights to be more atmospheric.

## GAMEPLAY

These mods tweak certain annoying or deficient aspects of the game's gameplay. Some of these are quality of life improvements, other simply make sense.

- [**Abundant Adamantium Ore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45726) by grasscid: every Raw Adamantium rock is guaranteed to have at least 2 pieces of Adamantium Ore.

### GAMEPLAY MWSE

These gameplay mods require MWSE to work properly. Thanks to the power of MWSE, many of these mods add neat new mechanics into the game, some present in older Elder Scrolls games, others entirely new. In many cases, these mods can be configured in-game to suit your particular tastes.

- [**Bed Buddies**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46632) by Merlord: prevents you from sleeping in owned beds unless the owner really likes you. Disposition requirement is based on your Personality. Attempting to sleep in an owned bed no longer triggers a crime, even if the owner doesn't like you.
- [**Book Pickup**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46625) by NullCascade: enables picking up books by default, instead of opening them. This can be disabled by holding shift. The behavior can be inverted using the mod config menu.

- [**Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599) by Stuporstar and Greatness7: automatically harvests herbs, instead of opening the container interface.

### GAMEPLAY MWSE ABOT

These mods all belong to the same author, abot. They receive a dedicated section because they need to be installed before **MWSEabotlib** for all of them to work correctly.

- [**Smart Ammo**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47383?) by abot: ammo autoequip while bow/crossbow/thrown weapon readied. It will remember and prefer last hand-picked ammo if pressing Alt while equipping it.

## GAME BALANCE

These gameplay mods seek to improve deficient aspects of the game's balance, such as the overabundace of overpowered equipment, how easy it is to get it, or the rebalance of the game's official expansions which were originally designed with an end-game character in mind.

- [**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort: rebalances Tribunal as if it shipped with Morrowind.
- [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort: rebalances Bloodmoon as if it shipped with Morrowind.
- [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/dgk6tqjzm4ebj67/Morrowind_Anti-Cheese_v1.2_%28Modding_Morrowind%29.zip/file) by Remiros and Half11: fixes the biggest exploits and balance issues in the game.
  - I've edited this mod for compatibility with **Ownership Overhaul**. [**You can find the original mod here.**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305)
- [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by mort: rebalances alcohol so that it is less effective than potions.
  - Only install the **Better Balanced Booze - Heavy Drinker Mode** main file.

### CLEANING PLUGINS

The following plugins are dirty and require cleaning. [Follow the instructions here on how to clean plugins.](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#cleaning-plugins)

- **Morrowind Anti-Cheese.ESP**
  - Clean with TESTool and tes3cmd.

### GAME BALANCE MWSE

These gameplay mods require MWSE to work properly. Most importantly, they deal with particularly broken gameplay mechanics.

- [**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade: provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.
- [**Harder Barter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46188) by mort: dynamically adjusts how much merchants will pay for items. Expensive items will be much less valuable while cheap items will be more or less the same price. Pluginless, compatible with everything.
  - MO2 will tell you there's no game data on top level. 
    - Right click **Data Files** and click **Set data directory**. Click **OK**.
- [**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299) by NullCascade: puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.

## DIALOGUE

For a dialogue mod to be included in this list, it must address a considerable problem with the game's existing dialogue. As it is, the most noticeable issues with Morrowind's dialogue (that aren't addressed by the **Internal logic** module) are minor annoyances or issues with its repetition.

- [**GreetDistanceReducer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43994) by helswake: NPCs will not shout at you as often when you walk by. They will still greet you, though, you just have to be a bit closer.
- [**Greetings for No Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46063) by Caeris: replaces the three standard No Lore greetings with over sixty new ones. 
- [**Outfit Greetings Tweaked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46066?) by Anille: greetings regarding clothes are now limited to clothiers, nobles and snooty High Elves.

## FINISHING TOUCHES

### MANUAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION

The following plugins will conflict with each other. [Follow the instructions here on how to delete records using TESAME.](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tesame)

- Delete the following records from **Yet Another Guard Diversity - Regular.esp** for compatibility with **Morrowind Anti-Cheese.esp**:
    - Cell **Balmora, Eastern Guard Tower**
    - This ensures there aren't new instances of guards in the Eastern Guard Tower.

### ADJUSTING YOUR LOAD ORDER

Before running the automated conflict resolution tools, we need to confirm your installed mods and plugins are in the right order. [**Follow the mod order and load order in this page**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/moddingmworder.md) and adjust your mod installation order and plugin load order accordingly before proceeding to the next step.

### AUTOMATED CONFLICT RESOLUTION

TES3Merge lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in MO2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

TESTool lets us merge the leveled lists in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds certain weapons for sale to vendor leveled lists, and another mod also does the same.

- Run TESTool in MO2.
- A window will pop up, asking you if you want to use your Morrowind root folder instead of registry settings. Click **Yes**.
- Select **Merge Leveled Lists for active plugins** and click **Execute**.
- Close the program. **Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

### SYNCHRONIZING MOD MASTERS

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run WryeMash in MO2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a **green box** next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.

### RUNNING DISTANT LAND

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [in this section](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in MO2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**, and then **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Once the statics have been created, simply click **Finish**.

### IN-GAME CONFIGURATION

Unless explicitly stated, configure these mods through the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

**Book Pickup**
- Set **Pickup by default?** to **No**.

**Clock Block**
- Set **Clock type** to **Game time**.

**Continue**
- Set **Hide Credits Button** and **Hide New Game Button (In Game)** to **Yes**.

**Essential Indicators**
- In the **General Settings** tab you can disable the features of the mod. I personally prefer playing with all settings off minus the following:
  - Enable Ownership Indicator. 
  - Enable Sneak Indicator.
  - Enable Messages.
  - Enable Tooltip for Quest Items.
- The remaining tabs offer additional configuration options. Feel free to configure them as you wish.

**Less Aggressive Creatures**
- In the **Peaceful Creatures Whitelist** tab, add the following creatures to the **Blocked** list:
  - cliff racer
  - cliff racer_diseased
  - mudcrab
  - mudcrab_diseased
  - rat
  - rat_diseased

**Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul**
- In the **General and Cell Settings** tab, set **Cell lighting value overrides** to **NONE**.
- In the **Light Settings** tab, set the **Light radius scaling** slider to **120%**.
- In the **Light Settings** tab, set **Disable lights without a mesh** to **On**.

**Putting Power in Willpower**
- Set **Allow negative Resist Bonus** to **On**.

**Security Enhanced**
- Set the **Assign Keybind for Lockpick Hotkey** key to **O** (the **L** is used by **Let There Be Darkness**).

**Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod**
- Access the in-game console by pressing the key to the left of the "1" key.
- Type **set fQuakeChance to 5** to reduce earthquake chance from 30% to 5%.

The mods installed in this guide and configured as mentioned above will use the following keys:

- **Quick Equip**: left click + Left Shift when clicking on inventory items will equip them or use them (in the case of consumables).
- **Kill Command**: button **K** to order attacks.
- **Scriptable Scriptures**: button **B** to switch between open and closed scriptures.
- **Security Enhanced**: buttons **O** and **P** to equip lockpicks and probes respectively.

Congratulations, your modded Morrowind installation is ready!
