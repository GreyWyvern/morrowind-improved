## FOLLOWING MODDING MORROWIND

### BEGINNING WITH MENDING MORROWIND

Modding Morrowind is a follow up guide to [**Mending Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendingmw.md). Whereas Modding Morrowind is about installing mods that expand on the original game, Mending Morrowind has all the pre-requisites needed to enjoy a stable and mostly bug-free Morrowind experience. Because of this, Modding Morrowind assumes you have already followed through with Mending Morrowind.

### CREATING SEPARATORS IN MOD ORGANIZER 2

Separators allow you to neatly separate installed mods in Mod Organizer 2 for ease of viewing. I recommend creating a separator for the following sections before installing these mods.

- Right click on the empty space on the mod order window, and click **Create Separator**.
- Name it accordingly to its category and click **OK**.

### INSTALLING THE MODULES

As explained in the main page, this guide is modular, and each module can be installed independent from each other. That said, for the sake of simplicity these are the steps you should following when installing any of these modules.

- Install a given module.
- Clean whatever dirty plugins it may have, as per their corresponding **Cleaning plugins** section.
- Jump into the **Finishing touches** section, which will contain the most general information.

Always remember that though these modules are independent from each other, they work with minimum conflicts if you install them in order, and if you install their respective mods in order as well. This doesn't mean you can't install modules and mods out of order, as Mod Organizer 2 lets us rearrange mod and plugin order after installing them. It just means following this guide in order will be your best bet at preserving your sanity.

Good luck!

  - This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.

## FINISHING TOUCHES

### MANUAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION

The following plugins will conflict with each other. [Follow the instructions here on how to delete records using TESAME.](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tesame)

- Delete the following records from **Yet Another Guard Diversity - Regular.esp** for compatibility with **Morrowind Anti-Cheese.esp**:
    - Cell **Balmora, Eastern Guard Tower**
    - This ensures there aren't new instances of guards in the Eastern Guard Tower.

### ADJUSTING YOUR LOAD ORDER

Before running the automated conflict resolution tools, we need to confirm your installed mods and plugins are in the right order. [**Follow the mod order and load order in this page**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/moddingmworder.md) and adjust your mod installation order and plugin load order accordingly before proceeding to the next step.

### AUTOMATED CONFLICT RESOLUTION

TES3Merge lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in MO2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

TESTool lets us merge the leveled lists in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds certain weapons for sale to vendor leveled lists, and another mod also does the same.

- Run TESTool in MO2.
- A window will pop up, asking you if you want to use your Morrowind root folder instead of registry settings. Click **Yes**.
- Select **Merge Leveled Lists for active plugins** and click **Execute**.
- Close the program. **Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

### SYNCHRONIZING MOD MASTERS

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run WryeMash in MO2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a **green box** next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.

### RUNNING DISTANT LAND

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [in this section](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in MO2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**, and then **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Once the statics have been created, simply click **Finish**.

### IN-GAME CONFIGURATION

Unless explicitly stated, configure these mods through the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

**Book Pickup**
- Set **Pickup by default?** to **No**.

**Clock Block**
- Set **Clock type** to **Game time**.

**Continue**
- Set **Hide Credits Button** and **Hide New Game Button (In Game)** to **Yes**.

**Less Aggressive Creatures**

  - cliff racer
  - cliff racer_diseased
  - mudcrab
  - mudcrab_diseased
  - rat
  - rat_diseased

**Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul**
- In the **General and Cell Settings** tab, set **Cell lighting value overrides** to **NONE**.
- In the **Light Settings** tab, set the **Light radius scaling** slider to **120%**.
- In the **Light Settings** tab, set **Disable lights without a mesh** to **On**.

**Putting Power in Willpower**
- Set **Allow negative Resist Bonus** to **On**.

**Security Enhanced**
- Set the **Assign Keybind for Lockpick Hotkey** key to **O** (the **L** is used by **Let There Be Darkness**).

The mods installed in this guide and configured as mentioned above will use the following keys:

- **Quick Equip**: left click + Left Shift when clicking on inventory items will equip them or use them (in the case of consumables).
- **Kill Command**: button **K** to order attacks.
- **Scriptable Scriptures**: button **B** to switch between open and closed scriptures.
- **Security Enhanced**: buttons **O** and **P** to equip lockpicks and probes respectively.

Congratulations, your modded Morrowind installation is ready!
