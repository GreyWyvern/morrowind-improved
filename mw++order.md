## MORROWIND++ CONFLICTS

Beyond mods that don't carry over bug fixes from the **Core** section, there are a number of plugins present in **Morrowind++** that are meant to be loaded in a given order to ensure they are working with the least amount of conflicts possible. The obvious ones have been already addressed in the guide itself (patches needed to load after the mods they are patching), and this section is only present to explain why some need a special load order.

- Yet Another Guard Diversity.esp
  - Load it just after the **Core - Bug Fixes and Optimization** section to prevent it from overwriting changes made by other mods installed in the guide.
