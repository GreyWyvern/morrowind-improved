Gives the hidden imperial door the same shading as the walls it is next to so that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.

[**Silt Strider Animation Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44150?)  
Restores previously unused Silt Strider animation - it was present in the model, but never played in the game itself because of the lack of the necessary script. It also comes with a previously unused sound.

[**The Publicans**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45410?)

- Right-click on the installed file and click **Open in Explorer**.
- Open **MWSE\mods\RFD\LetThereBeDarkness\main.lua** using a text editor. I recommend [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
- Comment out the **event.register("keyDown", openLiveLightEditing, {filter = tes3.scanCode.l})** using "--", like so:
```
local function initialized()
	event.register("cellChanged", checkPlayerCell)
	--event.register("keyDown", openLiveLightEditing, {filter = tes3.scanCode.l})
	editLights()
	mwse.log("[Let There Be Darkness] initialized")
	if (config.debugMode == true) then
		tes3.messageBox("[Let There Be Darkness] initialized")
	end
end
```
- Save your changes.

> This solves a compatibility issue with mods that use the **L** key as a hotkey, such as Security Enhanced, by disabling Let There Be Darkness Lighting Preview feature.

[**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816)  
Regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions.
- This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.
- Also install [**Weather Adjuster - Morrowind++ Preset**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1fqz9ovi69chkgp/Weather+Adjuster+-+Morrowind+++Preset+v2.1.zip/file). Personal preset for darker nights and less horrible fog.
  - This mod has to be installed manually. Unpack the file and merge the **overwrite** folder with your Mod Organizer 2 **overwrite** folder, found inside the **Mod Organizer 2** folder. The contents of the folder should like so: **Mod Organizer 2\overwrite\MWSE\config\Weather Adjuster.json**.

[**Bed Buddies**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46632)

The Warp Script for the Propylon Indices will now prompt you before teleporting. The Master Index version additionally lets you choose your destination when warping if you have the Master Index in your possession.

Lowers the position of the first person camera when sneaking/crouching, making it easier to tell if you are sneaking. Adjustable on the fly.

Enchant skill advances based on the cost of the enchantment cast, calculated as if it was a spell.

[**Hold Your Breath**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48872)  
Endurance determines how long you can hold your breath under water. Uses MWSE.

[**Magicka Based Skill Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330)

[**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715)  
Takes into account the distance to target when calculating the hit chance for ranged weapons. This applies to both the player and NPCs. Crouching also provides a boost to hit chance.

[**Putting Power In Willpower**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45742)  
Rebalances the willpower-based spell resist mechanic, giving all in-game actors, Player, NPCs and Creatures an ability to shrug off spells through the sheer force of will.
- Expand the **2.0** folder.
- Right-click on **Data Files**.
- Click **Set as data files directory**.
- Uncheck **Putting Power in Willpower - Absorbonach.ESP**

> This disables the gimmicky feature where Atronachs regenerate health from elemental attacks matching their element (they are immune to their own elements in the vanilla game either way).

[**Wings of Will - Willpower Based Levitation Speed**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46626)  
Levitation speed is now based on Willpower attribute instead of Speed. Calculations are otherwise the same.

## Mechanics

An alternative version of the official plugin Area Effect Arrows that distributes the new projectiles throughout the game world rather than dumping them all in one shop, and includes an integrated version of BTB's Area Effect Projectiles.
- Hide all plugins except **Area Effect Projectiles Integrated.ESP**

[**Blighted Blight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48631)  
Restores the possibility of contracting blight diseases while out in a blight storm.

[**Brutal Backstabbing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45890)  
Introduces a backstabbing mechanic - do more damage when stabbing an enemy from behind (based on Agility/Sneak). Mod Configuration Menu includes option for Short Blades only or all weapons. Be warned - NPCs can backstab you as well!

[**Dynamic Timescale**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48287)  
Changes how quickly time passes in-game depending on where you are and what you're doing.

[**Lua Lockbashing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48544)  
Adds in lock-bashing from Daggerfall.

> Abandon all lore-friendliness, ye who enter here. *Some* of these mods contradict established lore and in-game information in their quest to rebalance the game.

[**Class-Conscious Character Progression (CCCP)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110)  
An MWSE leveling mod that implements most features of Galsiah's Character Development. I strongly recommend you read the mod's page.

[**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232?tab=files)  
Provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions and ingredients the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.

[**Economy Adjuster Adjustments**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47130?)  
Increases the penalties for crime.
- Hide all plugins except **EcoAdjCrime (Necro Edit).ESP**

[**HardTrade**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/uuxqwctl9dxddax/HardTrade_v2.6_%2528Sigourn_Edit%2529.zip/file)  
Eliminates trade exploits by overhauling the bartering mechanics.
- Right-click on the installed file and click **Open in Explorer**.
- Open **MWSE\mods\HardTrade\main.lua** using a text editor. I recommend [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
- Comment out both **tes3.findGMST** lines and the **event.register("uiActivated", onPersuationMenu, {filter = "MenuPersuasion"})** line using "--", like so:
```
local function initialized(e)
--tes3.findGMST("fBargainOfferMulti").value = -10		tes3.findGMST("fSpellMakingValueMult").value = 10		tes3.findGMST("fEnchantmentValueMult").value = 100
--tes3.findGMST("fBribe10Mod").value = 20				tes3.findGMST("fBribe100Mod").value = 50				tes3.findGMST("fBribe1000Mod").value = 100
event.register("calcBarterPrice", onCalcBarterPrice)
event.register("calcTrainingPrice", onCalcPrice)
event.register("calcSpellPrice", onCalcPrice)
event.register("calcTravelPrice", onCalcPrice)
event.register("calcRepairPrice", onCalcPrice)
--event.register("filterInventory", onFilterInventory)
--event.register("uiActivated", onPersuationMenu, {filter = "MenuPersuasion"})
event.register("uiActivated", onBarterMenu, {filter = "MenuBarter"})
--event.register("uiActivated", onInventory, {filter = "MenuInventory"})
--event.register("menuEnter", onMenuEnter)
event.register("loaded", onLoaded)
end
event.register("initialized", initialized)
```
- Save your changes.

> By commenting out the two tes3.findGMST lines you will actually be commenting out *six* GMST edits, because of the way the code was written.

> This solves a compatibility issue with mods that alter these GMSTs (such as **BTB's Game Improvements**), and disables the Investing feature.

[**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299)  
Puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.

[**Nimble Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48251)

Modifies movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.

Modified version of BTB's Game Improvements by Necrolesian, with many changes and additions. Additional edits by me to remove some infuriating and/or unnecessary changes.
- Check the following options in the BAIN installer:
  - [X] 00 BTBGI Necro Edit
  - [ ] 01 BTBGI Necro Edit + Hunter's Mark Patch
  - [ ] 02 BTBGI Necro Edit + MDMD - Creatures Patch

[**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714)  
Rebalances Bloodmoon as if it shipped with Morrowind. Intended to be used with Beware the Sixth House.

# Finishing touches

## Additional Morrowind Code Patch patches

We installed the Morrowind Code Patch in the **Setup** page. However, certain mods installed in this guide require specific patches to work as intended.

Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **BTB's Game Improvements** removes the skill gain for consuming ingredients, and **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **BTB's Game Improvements** requires this patch for its weapon resistance changes to work as intended.

## Final mod order and load order

The mod order dictates the priority a given mod's assets have over the mods installed before it. Respect this order to ensure assets are overwritten as intended.

## Synchronizing mod masters

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run Wrye Mash in MO2 (**mash64**).
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a green box next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.

## Cleaning our plugins

**tes3cmd** lets us clean all active plugins in our load order, either individually or in bulk. The latter process has the unfortunate side effect of reverting the author entry of the plugins to "tes3cmd multipatch", in addition to cleaning mods that shouldn't be cleaned (in the case of this guide, Patch for Purists). The bulk process also takes quite a while. For more information on how to clean plugins in bulk, [**check the Tools section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tes3cmd).

For the purpose of this guide, we will only clean the plugins we know are dirty.

- Run Wrye Mash in MO2 (**mash64**).
- In the **Mods** tab, right click on each of the following plugins and click **Clean with tes3cmd**. After the process is over, close the window.
  - Divayth Fyr Puzzle Fixed.ESP

## Conflict resolution

**tes3cmd** also allows us to solve conflicts in leveled lists, generating a **multipatch.esp** file which will be placed at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds new weapons to a leveled list while another removes items from a leveled list (such as Daedric equipment).

- Run Wrye Mash in MO2 (**mash64**).
- In the **Mods** tab, click the **Misc** header and go to **TES3cmd** -> **Create MultiPatch**. Click **Yes** on the prompt.
- tes3cmd will now generate the multipatch. After the process is over, click **OK**.
- **multipatch.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

**TES3Merge** lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in MO2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.ESP** will now be present at the end of your load order. Activate the plugin.

**Merged Objects.ESP** makes a handufl of unintended changes to the Imperial Netch Blade, Iron Spider Dagger, and Stormkiss records when using BTBGI Necro Edit. We will have to delete these unintended changes from our Merged Objects plugin.

- [**Run TESAME in MO2**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tesame).
- Delete the following records: 
  - Weapon **iron spider dagger**
  - Weapon **imperial netch blade**
  - Weapon **Stormkiss**
- This omits the unintended changes made by Merged Objects to these weapons.

## Re-running Distant Land

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [**in this section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in MO2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**, and click **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Click **Finish** when the process is over.

## Closing commments

Broadly speaking, these are the steps you should follow whenever you install new mods. To summarize:

1. Get a reliable mod order and load order working.
2. Synchronize mod masters to avoid in-game warnings.
3. Clean dirty plugins.
4. Solve conflicts.
5. Re-run Distant Land.

# In-game configuration

## General adjustments

Launch Morrowind and make the following adjustments.

- Under the **Options** menu, go to the **Video** tab.
- The **Gamma Correction** slider lets you increase/decrease the brightness of your game. I like to play Morrowind with the slider roughly 40-45% of the way from left to right, making the game look less washed out.
- Turn the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. Morrowind's shadows are buggy, ugly, and are not worth the performance hit.

## Mod configuration

The following mods need to be configured using the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

### abot's Smart Journal

- Set **Add a prefix in order to group quest names?** to 0. This will remove the lag when opening the quest page without this option set to 0.
- Disable every option below **Sort quests list by quest name?**. These options are useful to troubleshoot mods, but we don't need them. 

### abot's Tooltip

- Disable **Show item Value/Weight Ratio in tooltip**.

### Clock Block

- Set **Clock position** to Bottom.
- Set **Clock type** to Game time.

### Continue

- Enable **Hide Credits Button**.

### Controlled Consumption

- Set **Current consumption module** to Vanilla NPC Style (Necro Edit).

### Dynamic Timescale

Cell Settings
- Set **Wilderness timescale** to 60. This will slow down the timescale when in wilderness cells by 50%. In my opinion, the default value is way too high.

### Essential Indicators

General Settings
- Disable **Essential Item Indicator**.
- Disable **Essential NPC Indicator**.
- Disable **Quest-Giver NPC Indicator**.
- Disable **Quest-Giver Faction Sensibility**.

Crosshair Settings  
- Set **Crosshair Scale** to 80%.
- Set **Sneaking Crosshair Scale** to 80%.

### HardTrade

- Disable **Limit player stats to 100 when trading**.

### Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul

General and Cell Settings
- Set **Cell lighting value overrides** to NONE.
- If you've installed the **specialprocess** shader in **Setup**, set all three **Ambient color adjustments** to 75.

Light Settings  
- Disable **Use TLaD overrides for radius and color of light sources?**.

### Limited Leaping

- Set **Cooldown between jumps** to 1.
- Set **Minimum fatigue to jump** to 20. This matches the fatigue drain for jumping when using BTB's Game Improvements.

### Putting Power in Willpower

- Enable **Allow negative Resist Bonus**.

### Security Enhanced

- Disable **Enable Lockpick Auto-Equip On Locked Object Activation**.
- Disable **Enable Probe Auto-Equip On Trapped Object Activation**.

### UI Expansion

Please bear in mind that your game *may* crash when configuring this mod. That said, whatever changes you made will persist after launching the game again.

- Set **Auto-select search bar** to None.
- (Optional) Set **Use verbose buttons instead of icons for inventory filtering?** to No.
- (Optional) Set **Use search bars?** to No.

## Mod keybindings

The mods installed in this guide and configured as mentioned above will use the following keys.

Key | Function | Added by
------------ | ------------- | -------------
U | Opens Quests menu | Hot Quests
I | Opens Topics menu | Hot Quests

# Compatibility

Morrowind# is a big guide and touches on many aspects of the game. Though this guide is presented "as is", it doesn't mean you can't install other mods on top; only that you should think twice about what you are installing.

For reference, here is a list of known mods in the guide that tend to have compatibility issues with other mods.

- **Ownership Overhaul**: this mod touches on a *lot* of items in the game which are unowned, including doors, and it's not unusual at all for other mods (particularly big overhauls, like towns and cities) to override many of the changes made by this mod to a given location (e.g. a Pelagiad overhaul overriding the ownership of many items). Moreover, mods that add items to the game world may not account for ownership either, meaning those items are free for the taking.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esms and .esps after Ownership Overhaul.
- **Yet Another Guard Diversity**: this mod replaces vanilla guards with unique guards selected from leveled lists. But because of how this mod works, it is perfectly possible for a mod to override its changes (by moving the vanilla guards around) and have the guards revert to their vanilla, generic appearance. This would be most noticeable with Imperial Legion guards who don't wear closed helmets (unlike their Hlaalu, Redoran, Telvanni, and Indoril counterparts). Moreover, new guards added to the game world will most likely have a generic appearance as well.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esps after Yet Another Guard Diversity.
- **Morrowind Anti-Cheese**, **BTB's Game Improvements - Necro Edit**: these mods make drastic changes to the game's balance, including the addition of new enemies to vanilla locations, stat tweaks to equipment and items, and edits to NPCs' inventories, stats, and spells. Any large overhaul that affects NPCs or vanilla items will quite possibly conflict with these mods (e.g. a faction overhaul, such as Vvardenfell Brotherhood or Morag Tong Polished). Depending on the conflict, it can be virtually harmless (without looking at TES3View you wouldn't even tell there is a conflict) or serious (an NPC that should have been buffed to a considerable degree reverts back to its vanilla, puny mook state).
  - Recommendation: use TES3View to look at conflicts and determine the best course of action, whether that is modifying your load order, using TESAME to delete conflicting records, or create a patch using the Construction Set.
