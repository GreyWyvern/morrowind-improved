## December 25th Hot Update

- Audio: removed Outdoor Banners With Sounds (barely noticeable).
- Gameplay: moved Light Decay to this section (makes more sense, since it affects how indoors exploration plays out).

## December 25th

"Try to avoid adding original content" was a big drive behind this update, along with removing most visual effect mods that added new things instead of improving on existing aspects of the game. Thus the large culling.

- Visuals: removed Bitter Coast Sounds - UMOPP Version.
- Visuals: removed Flies.
- Visuals: removed Heat Haze.
- Visuals: removed Mistify.
- Visuals: removed Perfectly Proficient Parasol Particles Performance Patch.
- Visuals: removed Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod.
- Visuals: removed The Dream is the Door.
- Visuals: removed Unto Dust.
- Visuals: removed Buoyant Lord Vivec.
- Visuals: removed Golden Saint Feminine Walk.
- Visuals: removed Improved Nordic Iron Helm Mesh.
- Visuals: removed Incarnates Overhauled.
- Visuals: removed Nordic Chest Replacer.
- Visuals: removed Practical Pauldrons - Streamlined Shoulders (seems like a very controversial mod).
- Visuals: removed Soldier Belts Fix.
- Visuals: removed Signposts Retextured (replaced with Near Vanilla Road Signs).
- Dialogue: removed Greetings for No Lore.
- Dialogue: removed Outfit Greetings Tweaked.
- Dialogue: removed Simple Smith Dialogue.
- Audio: added No Female Nord Screeching.
- Gameplay: removed Hunter's Mark - A Marksman Mod and Hunter's Mark + Area Effect Arrows Integrated Patch.
- Gameplay: removed One-handed Adamantium Axe.
- Difficulty: modified installation instructions for There Can Be Only One (now recommends the standard plugin; we simply delete the Divayth Fyr changes later). MDMD Patch has been modified as a consequence.

## December 24th

- Gameplay: removed Speed and Movement Rebalanced (unless you specifically try to make a character with high Speed and Athletics, you are going to hate this mod).

## December 20th

- Setup: added images to MGE XE section to aid with the options.
- Visuals: changed Bitter Coast Scum Replacer installation instructions (the recommended option is now Greener Color).
- Gameplay: fixed Hunter's Mark + Area Effect Arrows Integrated Patch.

- In-game configuration: added UI Expansion instructions.

## December 18th

- Setup: separated two distinct parts in MGE XE's installation instructions into their own sub-sections (installing shaders, launching MGE XE).
- Morrowind++: added links to the Finishing touches sub-section in the index.
- Core: updated Facelift installation instructions (no longer requires to download an update file).
- Visuals: added a disclaimer to Flies (known issue).
- Gameplay: added Improved Vanilla Leveling. **Refrain from installing this mod on an on-going playthrough**.
- Finising touches: added in-game configuration instructions for Magicka Based Skill Progression.
- Finising touches: added in-game configuration instructions for MWSE Magicka Regen.

## December 16th

- Setup: updated MGE XE section with new shaders instructions.
- Visuals: updated Remiros' Groundcover installation instructions with new shaders instructions.
- Visuals: simplified Bitter Coast Sounds installation instructions (package now installs vanilla-sized textures, no one will ever tell the difference).

## Legacy: Quests

It is not the intention of this guide to mess with existing quests in any way or form. Neither it is my intention to add content in the way of new quests. However, I leave this section up for anyone interested in a handful of perfectly compatible mods that expand on the vanilla content in a lore-friendly and compatible manner with Morrowind++.

- [**Blight at the Hairat-Vassamsi Egg Mine**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47589) by Gavrilo93  
Allows you to cure the kwama queen at the Hairat-Vassamsi Egg Mine.
- [**Frostmoth Repaired**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/27457?) by Talthybius  
This plugin repairs the walls of Fort Frostmoth as the Bloodmoon main quest progresses.
- [**Plunder the Dungeon**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46977) by Gavrilo93  
Plundering the Dungeon at Tel Fyr will be a real quest now, with a unique reward and some new dialogue that acknowledges your success.
- [**Shrine of Azura**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48278) by Endoran  
Populates the Shrine of Azura on the Azura's Coast with some pilgrims and a priestess along with some other edits.
- [**Sixth House Smugglers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47602) by Gavrilo93  
Adds Sixth House smugglers to some smuggler caves, and a non-journal quest to hunt them all down.
