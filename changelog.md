# CHANGELOG

## INDEX

- [Back to main page](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/readme.md)

## August 6th

Minor maintenance update. I've made both main guides more readable by listing each mod's description under its mod name instead of right next to it. I've also simplified the Modding Morrowind page that details conflicts, mod order and load order. The important information should be more obvious now, and the page is overall less cluttered (if I say a mod needs to be loaded before another, no need to list the second mod afterwards and explain it has to be loaded later: it's obvious).

- **Visuals**
  - Removed the hotfix patch for **Facelift**, as the author has addressed the bug in the mod's Update file.

## July 19th

This maintenance update replaced the traditional modorder and loadorder .txt files with two new pages for **Mending Morrowind** and **Modding Morrowind**. For Mending Morrowind, a page lists its mod order and load order. For Modding Morrowind, a page explains its asset conflicts between mods, its complete mod order, its plugin conflicts between mods, and its complete load order.

This will make it easier for me to update (no need to upload files and update links), as well as hopefully make it easier on the player, who will no longer have to make sure their mod and load order match 1:1 the ones provided, since now they will know what the specific conflicts and thus important load orders are meant to be followed.

- **Mending Morrowind**
  - Re-added [**Glowing Flames**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46124) (fixes some bugs regarding flames not covered by Morrowind Optimization Patch).
  
## July 5th

- **Game balance**
  - Replaced **Morrowind Anti-Cheese** with a **Modding Morrowind**-ready edited plugin.
- **Manual conflict resolution**
  - Removed instructions for **Morrowind Anti-Cheese**. Make sure to reinstall **Ownership Overhaul** to restore the previously deleted records.

## July 2nd

- **User interface**
  - Removed [**Poodle's Piddly Pointer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46121?) (unnecessary with Essential Indicators).
  - Added [**Essential Indicators**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48267).
  - Added [**Right Click Menu Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48458).
- **Visuals**
  - Added [**Weapon Sheathing - Bow Position Edit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48473?).

## June 25th

- **Visuals**
  - Added [**Unto Dust**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48435?)
- **Game balance**
  - Removed [**One of a Kind - Daedric Weapons Armor and Shields**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44923) (between Realistic Repair's damaged loot and Harder Barter's nerfing to sell prices, this mod's biggest impact is that it makes Daedric weapons a total bitch to find).

## June 21st

- **User interface**
  - Added [**Quick Equip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48341)
  - Added [**Title Screen and Logo Video Intro Reworked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43657)

  - Moved **Outfit Greetings Tweaked** to this section.

## June 20th

- **Internal logic**
  - Removed [**FMI - Current Councilors**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47342) (there are many dialogue inconsistencies like this regarding dead NPCs in the vanilla game).
  - Removed [**FMI - Note from the Archcanon Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45778) (there are many dialogue inconsistencies regarding your character's gender in the vanilla game).
  - Removed [**FMI - The Role They Were to Play**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46411) (see above).
  - Removed [**Lore Friendly Iron Warhammer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45939?tab=files) (it's just one mesh, tweaked not even because it looks stupid).
  - Removed [**True Scourge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43294/) (there are many inconsistencies regarding the abilities of artifacts in the game).

## June 19th

- **Gameplay**
  - Removed [**Aesliip's Ring - Fortify Maximum Magicka**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45744) (there are other cases of equipment having the Fortify Magicka enchantment, seems pointless to tackle it in just one case).
- **Gameplay MWSE**
  - Added [**Corsair83's Realistic Repair - Add-on - Patch for Purists Patch**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zsbdfs0dvj8doh0/Corsair83%27s_Realistic_Repair_-_Add-on_v1.1_-_Patch_for_Purists_Patch.zip/file).
- **Game balance**
  - Moved **One of a Kind - Daedric Weapons Armor and Shields** back to this section.

## June 18th

This was a massive update regarding the formatting of the **Mending Morrowind** and **Tools** section. With the changes done, I hope people will have a far easier time setting up Morrowind in the future. The most important changes have been redistributing the contents of this sections among three pages, with a new **Setup** page that contains all important and necessary steps before installing the Morrowind Code Patch and all other Mending Morrowind mods. Since it's easier for me to explain what each section explains now instead of listing what changes were made to each section, that's what I'll do right now.

- **Setup**
  - Explains how to install the game and what to do about the official plugins.
  - Explains what tools to install.
  - Explains how to install Mod Organizer 2 and how to set up the installed tools through Mod Organizer 2.
  - Explains how to configure MGE XE.
- **Mending Morrowind**
  - Guide for patching Morrowind. Covers the Morrowind Code Patch, installation of fixes, and a general section at the bottom for conflict solving, synchronizing mod masters, and running MGE XE'S Distant Land.
- **Modding Morrowind**
  - Guide for modding Morrowind extensively. Covers installation of mods, what plugins need to be cleaned at the end of each section, and a general section at the bottom for conflict solving, synchronizing mod masters, running MGE XE's Distant Land, and in-game configuration of mods.
- **Tools**
  - Addendum guide for Modding Morrowind. Covers the use of TESTool, tes3cmd and TESAME for cleaning plugins, the use of Wrye Mash for updating and repairing saves, and the use of TES3View to check for conflicts.

Because I've reinstalled Morrowind from scratch, this has also given me the opportunity to clarify the installation instructions of *many* mods (mostly those that were improperly packaged). The vast majority were already covered in the previous release, but now I've gone ahead and explained how to solve these packaging issues from Mod Organizer 2 itself.

In addition, we have the usual changes.

- **Internal logic**
  - Removed [**Outlander Yourself**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674) (not really an oversight, it was a conscious design decision from Bethesda).
- **Visuals**
  - Removed [**Glowing Bitter Coast**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47946?) (I felt like it stood out too much from the vanilla game given its unique glow maps, plus it made other mods unnecessarily complicated to install).
- **Gameplay**
  - Simplified **Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition** installation instructions.
  - Moved the following mods to their own **abot's mods** section under **Gameplay**:
    - **Smart Ammo**
    - **Loading Doors Lock Tune**
    - **Smart Map**
    - **MWSEabotlib**

## June 16th

This is a maintenance update. Some more mods have been removed, others have been re-added upon feedback.

- **Internal logic**
  - Removed [**Redoran Freeloaders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47321) (the Telvanni inn in Vivec should also allow renting rooms for free if you are Telvanni, plus inn prices are so meaningless even with economy mods that using an .esp isn't justified).
- **Visuals**
  - Removed [**Fang-Like Fang of Haynekhtnamet**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47505) (it's just *one* weapon and it's called a "fang" because it uses a fang, no need to make the weapon look like one literally).
  - Removed [**Luminous VFX Atronachs**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48291/) (adding glow maps to just a few creatures that don't even emit light in the vanilla game feels arbitrary).
  - Re-added [**Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105) (it's a very well done mod and adds a lot to the Molag Amur region).
- **Overhauls**
  - Re-added [**Atmospheric Delights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47472) (it's a very vanilla-friendly overhaul that makes the House of Earthly Delights even more special).
- **Gameplay**
  - Re-added [**Religions Elaborated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47843) (it has some important quality of life features that are better done than other mods that attempt the same).

## June 13th

This is the biggest update in the guide, for the wrong reasons. A vast amount of mods included in this guide tweaked minuscule aspects of the game that most players would probably not even notice. The mods that did tweak massive aspects of the game, however, had their own set of issues, more along the lines of the changes not really fitting into the vanilla game. I don't discard some of these mods making a return in the future, however. I'll offer general explanations as to why certain mods were removed.

The following mods were removed because they were replaced or will be replaced by other mods.

- [**FMI - Unique Lore Friendly Cave Rats**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47193) (replaced with **Synthesis Series - Creatures and Diseases**).
- [**Distant Mournhold**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43255/?) (will be replaced with **Open Mournhold**).
- [**Urnest Loot**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45616?) (re-replaced with **FMI - GraveDust**).

The following mods were removed because I feel the official plugins are terrible and reimplementing them is pointless.

- [**Unofficial Morrowind Official Plugins Patched**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43931)
- [**Necrolesian's Official Plugins Integrated**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/8jt6mxcqu7189z4/Necrolesian%27s_Official_Plugins_Integrated_v1.0.zip/file)
- [**UMOPP v3.0.4 (Necrolesian's Official Plugins Integrated Compatible)**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9fuw6xkv1mu1yk7/UMOPP_v3.0.4_%28Necrolesian%27s_Official_Plugins_Integrated_Compatible%29.zip/file)
- [**Area Effect Arrows Integrated + UMOPP v3.0.4 Patch**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2m6ckellmgskr9l/Area_Effect_Arrows_Integrated_+_UMOPP_v3.0.4_Patch.zip/file)
- [**Siege at Firemoth Weapon Gimp**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47730)

The following mods were removed because I feel the changes they make are so tiny it's not even worth it to install them. Often the player would not know something was ever wrong or that said mods were even necessary while playing the game, and what these mods would do is draw attention to that fact, prompting the player to install them.

- [**FMI - Athyn and Shardie**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47322)
- [**FMI - HulStop.**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47121)
- [**FMI - Ingredient Locations**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47324)
- [**King's Oath Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43284)
- [**Thickle-Lo - The Succulent Hackle-Lo Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47502)
- [**Forge of Hilbongard**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43222)
- [**R-Zero's Iron Towershield**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44025?)
- [**Skyrim-like Draugr Eyes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43277)
- [**Hortator and Nerevarine Titles**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/z5bcybwpas506iw/Hortator_and_Nerevarine_Titles_v1.0.zip/file)
- [**More Redoran Master Helms**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47600)
- [**Passing Time While Reading - MWSE Lua version**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48059)
- [**Soul Gems at Ghostgate**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47340)
- [**Ajiras Alchemy Reports**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/34180)
- [**Ajira's Alchemy Reports Randomised**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47550)
- [**Always there Spell Breaker**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47648?)
- [**Burial of a Taxman**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43962?)
- [**The Last of the Redas Family**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47953)

The following mods were removed because they made visual changes which I felt weren't in-line with the overall goal of the guide. Since the guide is about improving sensible visual aspects of the game, many of these felt out of place.

- [**Blighted Animals Retextured**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42245)
- [**Bound Weapon Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41778) and [**Bound Weapon Replacer Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46396)
- [**Snow Prince Armor Redux**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42344?) and [**Snow Prince Armor Redux - Icons and Restored Helm Patch**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/85y9f6mzl5q1yni/Snow_Prince_Armor_Redux_-_Icons_and_Restored_Helm_Patch.zip/file)
- [**Spriggans and Twiggans**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43350)
- [**Vanilla-Friendly Almalexia Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068)
- [**Red Vos**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44729)
- [**Tower of Vos**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43527)
- [**White Suran 2 - MD Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44153)

The following mods were removed because they added mechanics didn't really fit in with the rest of the new mechanics, which were usually quality of life improvements or mechanics brought in back from Arena and/or Daggerfall.

- [**Defensive Stance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46845)
- [**Ghost Revenge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674)
- [**Give a Gift**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46661)
- [**Illegal Summoning**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47105?)
- [**Immersive Mining**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46041)

The following mods were removed because I felt the degree of "original content" was far too high, especially when messing with NPCs and quests in the vanilla game. Some were removed because they weren't really "lore-friendly". Overall, quest tweaks and the removal of vanilla mechanics were entirely removed.

- [**Redaynia Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47646)
- [**TriangleTooth's Missing Characters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46234?)

- [**Gaenor's Millions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44870)
- [**Hircine's Artifacts**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47671)

- [**Imperial Silver Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47751/)
- [**Legion Uniform Apathy**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46024)
- [**Morag Tong Writ Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47788/)
- [**Pacifist Options - When it Makes Sense**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47961)
- [**Quests for Faction Leaders Cleaned**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6xj6ew67bzey0db/Quests_for_Faction_Leaders_Cleaned_v1.4.zip/file)

- [**The G93 Vanilla Quest Tweaks RP Choices Consequences Super Mega Package - Ultimate Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47466) and [**Dubdilla Location Fix - A Cure for Vampirism Patch**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zxjoeye5haxrnk7/Dubdilla_Location_Fix_-_A_Cure_for_Vampirism_Patch_v1.0.zip/file)
- [**Vodunius Nuccius House Lodgings**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46364)

The following mods were removed strictly out of personal taste. I don't discard bringing them back in the future if I find myself missing them.

- [**What is something that can be perceived with one of your senses of life - Something edgy related to death my brother**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47598)
- [**Brevur of Balmora - Finally Some Good Statue Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47557)
