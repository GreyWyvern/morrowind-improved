# MORROWIND++ CHANGELOG

[Back to Morrowind++](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++.md#morrowind)

## December 4th

- Visuals: removed **Meteorite Ministry**. It stands out too much from the vanilla game.
- Audio: removed **Distant Thunder**. Unnecessarily complicated installation instructions for such a non-issue.
- Gameplay: updated **Ownership Overhauls** installation instructions. Now asks to hide the .esp plugin.
- Overhauls: removed **Passage of Prayers - High Fane Corridor Overhaul**. It stands out too much from the vanilla game.
- Overhauls: removed **Seven Graces Shrines - Enhanced**. It stands out too much from the vanilla game.

To revert the INI changes from **Distant Thunder**, replace the following INI lines with these values.  

> Thunder Sound ID 0=Thunder0  
> Thunder Sound ID 1=Thunder1  
> Thunder Sound ID 2=Thunder2  
> Thunder Sound ID 3=Thunder3  

- Added quality of life improvements to the guide's links (they will now take you to the top header instead of dropping you at the very beginning).

## December 2nd

- Visuals: replaced link for **Incarnates Overhauled**. Now with the proper .esp name.
- Overhauls: removed **No-Frills Open Vivec**. The performance hit and compatibility issues are too big to ignore.
- Overhauls: removed **No-Frills Closed Molag Mar**. Pretty much pointless without the above mod installed.
- Overhauls: removed **Reclamations in Holamayan**. Hardly essential.
- Separated the Visuals section into multiple sections.

## December 1st

This is a major update to the guide, which has been renamed to **Morrowind++**. For what it's worth, anyone already playing the game should keep playing instead of trying to keep up with the changes (which were motivated by subjective opinion over objective reasons, like bugs), hence the very sparse changelog.

What are the major changes since the last version, you ask? These:

- The two former guides have been merged into a single guide: **Morrowind++**. 
- The former **Mending Morrowind** guide has been greatly expanded and renamed to **Core**. Here you will find bug fixes, high resolution vanilla textures, quality of life improvements, restored content, and expansion reimplementation. This was inspired by Qolore7's [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) guide.
- Broadly speaking, mods have been moved around to simplify the structure of the guide, and sub-categories have been added to some sections which I found fitting.

## Legacy: Quests

It is not the intention of this guide to mess with existing quests in any way or form. This means that modifying a quest by adding new options, changing its rewards, or adding more flavor to it, is out of the question. Neither it is my intention to add content in the way of new quests. However, I leave this section up for anyone interested in these mods.
