## December 1st

This is a major update to the guide, which has been renamed to **Morrowind++**. For what it's worth, anyone already playing the game should keep playing instead of trying to keep up with the changes (which were motivated by subjective opinion over objective reasons, like bugs), hence the very sparse changelog.

What are the major changes since the last version, you ask? These:

- The two former guides have been merged into a single guide: **Morrowind++**. 
- The former **Mending Morrowind** guide has been greatly expanded and renamed to **Core**. Here you will find bug fixes, high resolution vanilla textures, quality of life improvements, restored content, and expansion reimplementation. This was inspired by Qolore7's [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) guide.
- Broadly speaking, mods have been moved around to simplify the structure of the guide, and sub-categories have been added to some sections which I found fitting.

## Legacy: Quests

It is not the intention of this guide to mess with existing quests in any way or form. Neither it is my intention to add content in the way of new quests. However, I leave this section up for anyone interested in a handful of perfectly compatible mods that expand on the vanilla content in a lore-friendly and compatible manner with Morrowind++.

- [**Blight at the Hairat-Vassamsi Egg Mine**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47589) by Gavrilo93  
Allows you to cure the kwama queen at the Hairat-Vassamsi Egg Mine.
- [**Frostmoth Repaired**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/27457?) by Talthybius  
This plugin repairs the walls of Fort Frostmoth as the Bloodmoon main quest progresses.
- [**Plunder the Dungeon**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46977) by Gavrilo93  
Plundering the Dungeon at Tel Fyr will be a real quest now, with a unique reward and some new dialogue that acknowledges your success.
- [**Shrine of Azura**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48278) by Endoran  
Populates the Shrine of Azura on the Azura's Coast with some pilgrims and a priestess along with some other edits.
- [**Sixth House Smugglers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47602) by Gavrilo93  
Adds Sixth House smugglers to some smuggler caves, and a non-journal quest to hunt them all down.
