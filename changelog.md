I think this should be the last sweep I do for the guide, when it comes to removing mods.

Re-structuring:

- Visuals: removed Visual Effects section, renamed remaining sections to New Features and Tweaks, 

Additions:

- Dialogue: FMI - Legion Dialogue

Removals:

- Core: Dry Stone Walls Revamped
- Core: Silver and Nordic Cuirasses Fixed
- Core: Services Restored
- Core: Sound Spell Sound Effect
- Core: Book Pickup
- Core: Clock Block
- Core: Gondolier Destinations
- Core: Inventory mouse wheel

## December 7th

Maintenance:

- Gameplay: fixed Nexus link for Enchantment Capacity Rebalance. Was previously linking to Projectile Enchant Capacity.
- Visuals: added additional instructions for Let There Be Darkness.

Additions:

- Gameplay: Borrowed Time
- Gameplay: Harder Taunting
- Gameplay: No Disposition Bonus For Bartering
- Gameplay: Ordinator Armour Fix** (replaces FMI - Sane Ordinators)

Removals:

- Core: modified GH Patches and Replacers installation instructions to remove Diverse Ore Veins. This mod reduced variety on the game's textures.

## December 6th

Re-structuring:

- Core: moved Beware the Sixth House to this section. Since mort's major rebalances were meant to be used together, it only made sense.
- Core: moved Dry Stone Walls Revamped to this section. It's a UV fix, much like Correct Meshes.
- Gameplay: merged New mechanics and Balance into a single section. Most "new mechanics" were rebalances of their own, and new mechanics inevitably modify the balance of the game, particularly when they add critical hits and backstabbing.
- Overhauls: removed this section since it only contained one mod. Moved Yet Another Guard Diversity to Visuals.
- Gameplay: moved Ownership Overhaul to the Balance and Mechanics section. It's a general anti-cheese over a mod that fixes an oversight.
- Visuals: moved Buoyant Lord Vivec to the Visual Effects section.
- Visuals: moved the following mods to the Other Visual Tweaks sub-section. This section now contains visual tweaks that deal with the vanilla assets, instead of adding entirely new visual effects.
  - Apel's Rain Replacer
  - Better Waterfalls
  - Waterfalls Tweaks
  - Bitter Coast Scum Replacer
  - Improved Thrown Weapon Projectiles
  - Mist Retexture
  - Realistic Blood
  - Skeleton and Metal Sparks Blood Retexture
  - Subtle Magic Glow
  - Subtle Smoke
  - Vivec Palace Water Replacer

Additions:

- Core: No Translation Tooltips.
- Gameplay: Hold Your Breath.
- Gameplay: Lua Lock Bashing.
- Gameplay: Visible Alchemy Success Chance.
- Gameplay: Visible Persuasion Chance.
- Gameplay: Wading in Water MW.

Removals:

- Visuals: Simple Golden Gold. Really small mod, hardly makes a difference.
- Visuals: Soldier Belts Fix. Really small mod, hardly makes a difference.
- Gameplay: Better Balanced Booze. Really small mod, hardly makes a difference when it comes to adding "balance" into Morrowind.
- Gameplay: Higher Faction Requirements. Of all mods in the balance section, this is the only one meant to make the game "harder" for the sake of it (Harder Barter just looks to smooth out progression and disallow cheesing).

## December 5th

For the first time in months, I'm bringing the guide up to date! \o/

- Core: added **Silver and Nordic Cuirasses Fixed**.
- Core: added **Blighted Blight**. Replaces **Blight Storms Restored**.
- Core: added **Comrade Raven's Book Arts Replacer**.
- Core: added **Better Buoyancy**
- Core: added **Pluginless and Adjustable Lower First Person Sneak**. Replaces **Lower First Person Sneak Mode**.
- Visuals: added **Perfectly Proficient Parasol Particles Performance Patch**. Replaces **Parasol Particles**.
- Visuals: added **Dry Stone Walls Revamped**.
- Visuals: added **Imperial Female Cuirass Retex**.
- Visuals: added **Practical Pauldrons - Streamlined Shoulders**.
- Gameplay: added **One-handed Adamantium Axe**.
- Gameplay: added **Enchant Capacity Rebalanced**. Replaces **Projectile Enchant Capacity**.
- Dialogue: added **Idle Talk**.
- Dialogue: added **Its a Deal**.
- Dialogue: added **Simple Smith Dialogue**.
- Dialogue: moved **FMI - Hospitality Papers** to this section.
- Dialogue: moved **FMI - Sane Ordinators** to this section.
- Dialogue: moved **FMI - Service Refusal and Contraband** to this section.

The following mods have been removed for consistency with the other mods in their respective sections:

- Visuals: removed **The Midnight Oil - Lighting Overhaul**.
- Visuals: removed **Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod**.
- Gameplay: removed **Blight is Coming**.
- Gameplay: removed **Lock Bashing**.
- Gameplay: removed **Merlord's Starting Equipment**.
- Gameplay: removed **Poison Crafting**.
- Gameplay: removed **Realistic Repair** and **Realistic Repair Add-On**.
- Overhauls: removed **Shrine of Azura**.

Other removed mods:

- Gameplay: removed **Corprus Fix**. Patch for Purists will include a similar fix in the future.

## December 4th

- Visuals: removed **Meteorite Ministry**. Stands out too much from the vanilla game.
- Audio: removed **Distant Thunder**. Unnecessarily complicated installation instructions for such a non-issue.
- Gameplay: updated **Ownership Overhauls** installation instructions. Now asks to hide the .esp plugin.
- Gameplay: added **Beware the Sixth House**. Was listed in the mod order and load order, but missing from Morrowind++.
- Overhauls: removed **Passage of Prayers - High Fane Corridor Overhaul**. Stands out too much from the vanilla game.
- Overhauls: removed **Seven Graces Shrines - Enhanced**. Stands out too much from the vanilla game.

To revert the INI changes from **Distant Thunder**, replace the following INI lines with these values.  

> Thunder Sound ID 0=Thunder0  
> Thunder Sound ID 1=Thunder1  
> Thunder Sound ID 2=Thunder2  
> Thunder Sound ID 3=Thunder3  

- Added quality of life improvements to the guide's links (they will now take you to the top header instead of dropping you at the very beginning).
- Added **Hunter's Mark - A Marksman Mod** to the mod order and load order.

## December 2nd

- Visuals: replaced link for **Incarnates Overhauled**. Now with the proper .esp name.
- Overhauls: removed **No-Frills Open Vivec**. The performance hit and compatibility issues are too big to ignore.
- Overhauls: removed **No-Frills Closed Molag Mar**. Pretty much pointless without the above mod installed.
- Overhauls: removed **Reclamations in Holamayan**. Hardly essential.
- Separated the Visuals section into multiple sections.

## December 1st

This is a major update to the guide, which has been renamed to **Morrowind++**. For what it's worth, anyone already playing the game should keep playing instead of trying to keep up with the changes (which were motivated by subjective opinion over objective reasons, like bugs), hence the very sparse changelog.

What are the major changes since the last version, you ask? These:

- The two former guides have been merged into a single guide: **Morrowind++**. 
- The former **Mending Morrowind** guide has been greatly expanded and renamed to **Core**. Here you will find bug fixes, high resolution vanilla textures, quality of life improvements, restored content, and expansion reimplementation. This was inspired by Qolore7's [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) guide.
- Broadly speaking, mods have been moved around to simplify the structure of the guide, and sub-categories have been added to some sections which I found fitting.

## Legacy: Quests

It is not the intention of this guide to mess with existing quests in any way or form. This means that modifying a quest by adding new options, changing its rewards, or adding more flavor to it, is out of the question. Neither it is my intention to add content in the way of new quests. However, I leave this section up for anyone interested in these mods.
