# Introduction

## Following the Setup guide

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed the installation instructions found in the [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#setup) page. Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Morrowind.

## Basic modding tips

### Don't uninstall mods mid-playthrough

A lot of things can go wrong when uninstalling a mod mid-playthrough. Some, expected. Some, completely unexpected.

### Always keep backup saves

Before you install a mod you are not completely sure about, make a backup of your save in case things go wrong.
Before you uninstall a mod you are not completely sure about, make a backup of your save in case things go wrong.

### Read the descriptions

Mod descriptions exist for a reason. The elaborate ones, for *good* reasons. Descriptions tend to list things such as:

- Requirements: mods or utilities a given mod needs to work as intended.
- Compatibility issues: known conflicts with other mods, whether general or specific.
- Known issues: bugs or unintended behavior.

Reading descriptions helps you troubleshoot mods, and what's more, decide beforehand whether a mod is worth the trouble of installing it.

### File structure matters

The file structure is how files are organized for the game to read these files and use them. Incorrect file structure accounts for a good deal of mods that donâ€™t work properly.

### BSAs and Morrowind.ini

ome mods come with BSA files. These contain data files for the mod. The most popular mod which includes BSA files is the **Tamriel Rebuilt** project, which is not part of this guide. **BSA files** need to be **registered** in your Morrowind.ini file for the game to properly load the assets. Failing to do so results in a well known phenomenom of [**yellow exclamation triangles**](https://external-preview.redd.it/dl-I4l_Pzm5autet-87p1hnU1btUavtiu1mtwGzWBko.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d180a6476cad80c332c12be08252511a0044c5c).

> Morrowind++ features no mods that use BSA files. If you ever install a mod that requires you to register BSA files, or otherwise modify your Morrowind.ini, remember to edit your .ini using Mod Organizer 2's Tools ![Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/mw2_update/MO_ini.png) button.

## Mod Organizer 2 tips

### Repackaging mods

There will be times you'll be greeted with the following message when installing a mod through Mod Organizer 2.

> **The content of data files does not look valid.**

In lieu of mod authors not fixing their mods themselves, there are two ways to fix this.

- Repackage the mod yourself and install it through Mod Organizer 2.
- Repackage the mod yourself *in* Mod Organizer 2.

The concept of a mod package is simple: if Mod Organizer 2 recognizes *anything* resembling a file structure (folders such as **Meshes** and **Textures**, or **.esp** and **.esm** files) the mod will be considered valid.

![DataFiles1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/mw2_update/MO2_FixingData1.png)

In this case, the mod contains a **Data Files** folder and a loose **.txt** file acting as the mod's documentation.

- Right-click on **Data Files**.
- Click **Set as data files directory**.
- The message will tell you the content of data files looks valid.

Whenever you encounter this scenario, just do as I've shown above.

![DataFiles2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/mw2_update/MO2_FixingData2.png)

In this case, the mod contains loose files, and you will have to create a folder to drop them in.

Right-clicking on **data files** and clicking **Create directory...** will let you create a folder, and then it's just a matter of drag and dropping your files inside.

- Right-click on **data files**.
- Click **Create directory...**.
- Enter the name of the folder you want to create, and click **OK**.
- The message will tell you the content of data files looks valid.

Whenever you encounter this scenario, I'll tell you which folders you have to create and what files do you have to move.

### Hiding files

Mod Organizer 2 lets you hide specific files from your installed mods, including anything from meshes to textures, but also plugins. This is a especially useful feature when you deactivate certain plugins from a mod but don't want to see them cluttering up your load order, or you want certain files not to overwrite another mod's.

- To hide a plugin, right click on your installed mod and click **Information...**.
- On the **Filetree** tab, right click on the plugins, folders, or files you want to hide, and click **Hide**.
- Mod Organizer 2 will hide the files, and these will no longer affect your game.

### The Overwrite folder

The **Overwrite** folder is the destiny folder for the output of many of the tools we installed in **Setup**, e.g. distant Land generation will place its contents inside the **distantland** folder, configurable MWSE mods will place their files inside the **MWSE\config** folder. There's always a chance files in the **Overwrite** folder will overwrite assets and/or plugins from your installed mods.

## Expansion implementation

[**Expansion Delay**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47588)  
Fixes Bethesda's overly enthusiastic expansion hooks by delaying the Dark Brotherhood attacks (for Tribunal) and limiting intrustive dialogue topics to a few NPCs (Bloodmoon).

Allows travel to Mournhold before the Dark Brotherhood attacks begin.

	--event.register("keyDown", openLiveLightEditing, {filter = tes3.scanCode.l})
	editLights()
	mwse.log("[Let There Be Darkness] initialized")

[**Light Decay**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46671)  
The radius of a handheld light will gradually diminish and eventually go out when the light extinguishes.

[**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816)  
Regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions.
- This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.
- Also install [**Weather Adjuster - Morrowind++ Preset**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1fqz9ovi69chkgp/Weather+Adjuster+-+Morrowind+++Preset+v2.1.zip/file). Personal preset for darker nights and less horrible fog.
  - This mod has to be installed manually. Unpack the file and merge the **overwrite** folder with your Mod Organizer 2 **overwrite** folder, found inside the **Mod Organizer 2** folder. The contents of the folder should like so: **Mod Organizer 2\overwrite\MWSE\config\Weather Adjuster.json**.

## Synchronizing mod masters

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run Wrye Mash in MO2 (**mash64**).
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a green box next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.

## Conflict resolution

**tes3cmd** also allows us to solve conflicts in leveled lists, generating a **multipatch.esp** file which will be placed at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds new weapons to a leveled list while another removes items from a leveled list (such as Daedric equipment).

- Run Wrye Mash in MO2 (**mash64**).
- In the **Mods** tab, click the **Misc** header and go to **TES3cmd** -> **Create MultiPatch**. Click **Yes** on the prompt.
- tes3cmd will now generate the multipatch. After the process is over, click **OK**.
- **multipatch.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

**TES3Merge** lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in MO2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.ESP** will now be present at the end of your load order. Activate the plugin.

## Re-running Distant Land

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [**in this section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in MO2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**, and click **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Click **Finish** when the process is over.

## Closing commments

Broadly speaking, these are the steps you should follow whenever you install new mods. To summarize:

1. Get a reliable mod order and load order working.
2. Synchronize mod masters to avoid in-game warnings.
3. Clean dirty plugins (there are no dirty plugins present in Morrowind++).
4. Solve conflicts.
5. Re-run Distant Land.

# In-game configuration

## General adjustments

Launch Morrowind and make the following adjustments.

- Under the **Options** menu, go to the **Video** tab.
- The **Gamma Correction** slider lets you increase/decrease the brightness of your game. I like to play Morrowind with the slider roughly 40-45% of the way from left to right, making the game look less washed out.
- Turn the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. Morrowind's shadows are buggy, ugly, and are not worth the performance hit.

## Mod configuration

The following mods need to be configured using the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

### abot's Smart Journal

- Set **Add a prefix in order to group quest names?** to 0. This will remove the lag when opening the quest page without this option set to 0.
- Disable every option below **Sort quests list by quest name?**. These options are useful to troubleshoot mods, but we don't need them. 

### Continue

- Enable **Hide Credits Button**.

### Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul

General and Cell Settings
- Set **Cell lighting value overrides** to NONE.
- If you've installed the **specialprocess** shader in **Setup**, set all three **Ambient color adjustments** to 75.

Light Settings  
- Disable **Use TLaD overrides for radius and color of light sources?**.

### UI Expansion

Please bear in mind that your game *may* crash when configuring this mod. That said, whatever changes you made will persist after launching the game again.

- Set **Auto-select search bar** to None.
- (Optional) Set **Use verbose buttons instead of icons for inventory filtering?** to No.
- (Optional) Set **Use search bars?** to No.

## Mod keybindings

The mods installed in this guide and configured as mentioned above will use the following keys.

Key | Function | Added by
------------ | ------------- | -------------
L | Equips lockpicks | Security Enhanced
P | Equips probes | Security Enhanced
C | Equips light sources | Torch Hotkey

# Compatibility

Morrowind++ is a rather conservative guide and touches few aspects of the game. Though this guide is presented "as is", it doesn't mean you can't install other mods on top; only that you should think twice about what you are installing.

For reference, here is a list of known mods in the guide that tend to have compatibility issues with other mods.

- **Yet Another Guard Diversity**: this mod replaces vanilla guards with unique guards selected from leveled lists. But because of how this mod works, it is perfectly possible for a mod to override its changes (by moving the vanilla guards around) and have the guards revert to their vanilla, generic appearance. This would be most noticeable with Imperial Legion guards who don't wear closed helmets (unlike their Hlaalu, Redoran, Telvanni, and Indoril counterparts). Moreover, new guards added to the game world will most likely have a generic appearance as well.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esps after Yet Another Guard Diversity.
