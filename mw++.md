## INTRODUCTION

### MODDING TIPS

A crash course to Morrowind and Bethesda modding in general is:

- Don't uninstall mods mid-playthrough, and if you do, keep a pre-uninstallation savefile as a backup in case things go wrong.
- Read the description of every mod you install. Descriptions usually list requirements, compatibility issues, and known issues in a mod. This not only prevents future issues (or assures you they are "normal" or "expected"), but it also helps you decide beforehand whether a mod is worth the trouble.
- File structure matters when installing a mod. The file structure is how files are organized for the game to read these files and use them. Incorrect file structure accounts for a good deal of mods that donâ€™t work properly. For instance, .esm and .esp files always need to be inside **Morrowind\Data Files**, or else the game simply won't register them. When a mod listed here has packaging issues, I will tell you how to fix them. Bear in mind that some mods do keep optional plugins in a separate folder, but these are the exception and descriptions usually make mentions of them.
- Some mods come with BSA files. These contain data files for the mod. The most popular mod which includes BSA files is the Tamriel Rebuilt project, which is not part of this guide. BSA files need to be registered in your Morrowind.ini file for the game to properly load the assets; failing to due so results in a well known problem of [**yellow exclamation triangles**](https://external-preview.redd.it/dl-I4l_Pzm5autet-87p1hnU1btUavtiu1mtwGzWBko.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d180a6476cad80c332c12be08252511a0044c5c). This particular guide, however, features no mods with BSA files. Broadly speaking, mods with BSA files tend to add lots of new assets into the game (meshes and textures), and this guide is focused with mostly vanilla graphics in mind.

When installing mods manually, by extracting the contents of a mod and dropping them inside your Data Files folder, there is a chance you will be overwriting one mod's files with another mod's. This is where mod managers come in: they make modding easy by providing you with lots of tools to aid you in modding your game.

**Mod Organizer 2** lets you hide specific files from your installed mods, including anything from meshes to textures, but also plugins. This is a especially useful feature when you deactivate certain plugins from a mod but don't want to see them cluttering up your load order, or you want to certain files not to overwrite another mod's.

- To hide a plugin, right click on your installed mod and select **Information...**.
- Select the **Filetree** tab.
- Right click on the plugins, folders, or files you want to hide, and select **Hide**.
- Mod Organizer 2 will hide the files, and these will no longer affect your game.

### CREATING SEPARATORS IN MOD ORGANIZER 2

Separators allow you to neatly separate installed mods in Mod Organizer 2 for ease of viewing. I recommend creating a separator for the following sections before installing these mods.

- Right click on the empty space on the mod order window, and click **Create Separator**.
- Name it accordingly to its category and click **OK**.

One more quirk about Mod Organizer 2 is the **Overwrite** folder and how it ties together with the tools we installed in the **Setup** section. The **Overwrite** folder is the destiny folder for the output of many of these tools. For instance, Distant Land generation will place its contents here, inside the **distantland** folder. Files in the **Overwrite** folder will overwrite all your installed assets and plugins, should they have the same names.

### INSTALLING THE MODULES

As explained in the main page, this guide is modular, and each module can be installed independently from each other (sans patches that cover mods from multiple sections, you'll easily tell which ones these are). However, for the sake of simplicity these are the steps you should following when installing any of these modules.

- Install a given module.
- Clean whatever dirty plugins it may have, as per their corresponding **Cleaning plugins** section.
- Jump into the **Finishing touches** section, which will contain the most general information.

Just because the guide has an order it doesn't mean you can't install modules or mods out of order: Mod Organizer 2 lets us rearrange mod and plugin order after installing them. But rest assured, following the guide in order will be your best bet at preserving your sanity.

### QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS

These mods address various issues with Morrowind's gameplay and user interface, from the minor and annoying to the large and infuriating. That said, none of these affect the basic gameplay and balance of the game: they simply make playing Morrowind more enjoyable, usually through quality of life features that were sorely lacking. Thus they are encouraged even for a first playthrough.

Expands UI functionality with searching, filtering, and more visual feedback.

### EXPANSION REIMPLEMENTATION

The Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions were poorly integrated into the base game. These mods modify how the player is introduced to them, and modifies the balance of the expansions as to blend in seamlessly with the vanilla game.

- [**Expansion Delay**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47588?) by half11  
Modifies how the Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions are implemented into the game. This is an essential mod for anyone who thinks Bethesda's expansions deserved a better implementation.

## VISUALS

Morrowind is a 2002 game but, unlike what many people think, a fairly beautiful one thanks to a strong artstyle and MGE XE's features. The mods in this section aren't meant to overhaul what Morrowind looks like. That is, if you think Morrowind is an ugly game, the mods here won't do much to change your mind. But it is my hope that, if you already enjoy Morrowind's aesthetic, these will make it even better for you.

### READABLE SIGNPOSTS

Choose between one of these two alternatives for readable signposts. My personal preference is PeterBitt's, but if you are a vanilla purist nothing beats Atrayonis'.

  - This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.
- [**Weather Adjuster - Morrowind Improved json**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/r7vlwhoko8rg2co/Weather_Adjuster_-_Sigourn%2527s_Mod_List_json.zip/file) by Sigourn

### MANUAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION

- Delete the following records from **Yet Another Guard Diversity - Regular.esp** for compatibility with **Morrowind Anti-Cheese.esp**:
    - Cell **Balmora, Eastern Guard Tower**
    - This ensures there aren't new instances of guards in the Eastern Guard Tower.

### ADJUSTING YOUR LOAD ORDER

Before running the automated conflict resolution tools, we need to confirm your installed mods and plugins are in the right order. [**Follow the mod order and load order in this page**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++order.md) and adjust your mod installation order and plugin load order accordingly before proceeding to the next step.

### AUTOMATED CONFLICT RESOLUTION

TES3Merge lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in MO2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

TESTool lets us merge the leveled lists in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds certain weapons for sale to vendor leveled lists, and another mod also does the same.

- Run TESTool in MO2.
- A window will pop up, asking you if you want to use your Morrowind root folder instead of registry settings. Click **Yes**.
- Select **Merge Leveled Lists for active plugins** and click **Execute**.
- Close the program. **Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

### SYNCHRONIZING MOD MASTERS

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run WryeMash in MO2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a **green box** next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.

### RUNNING DISTANT LAND

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [**in this section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in MO2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**, and then **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Once the statics have been created, simply click **Finish**.

### IN-GAME CONFIGURATION

Regardless of the extent you've followed this guide through, I recommend making the folllowing in-game adjustments.

- Under the **Options** menu, go to the **Video** tab.
- The **Gamma Correction** slider lets you increase/decrease the brightness of your game. I like to play Morrowind with the slider roughly 40-45% of the way from left to right, making the game look less washed out.
- Turn the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. These shadows look pretty bad, are glitchy, and not worth the performance hit.

The following mods require additional configuration through the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

**Book Pickup**
- Set **Pickup by default?** to **No**.

**Clock Block**
- Set **Clock type** to **Game time**.

**Continue**
- Set **Hide Credits Button** and **Hide New Game Button (In Game)** to **Yes**.

**Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul**
- In the **General and Cell Settings** tab, set **Cell lighting value overrides** to **NONE**.
- In the **Light Settings** tab, set the **Light radius scaling** slider to **120%**.
- In the **Light Settings** tab, set **Disable lights without a mesh** to **On**.

**Putting Power in Willpower**
- Set **Allow negative Resist Bonus** to **On**.

**Security Enhanced**
- Set the **Assign Keybind for Lockpick Hotkey** key to **O** (the **L** is used by **Let There Be Darkness**).

**Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod**
- Access the in-game console by pressing the key to the left of the "1" key.
- Type **set fQuakeChance to 5** to reduce earthquake chance from 30% to 5%.

The mods installed in this guide and configured as mentioned above will use the following keys:

- **Quick Equip**: left click + Left Shift when clicking on inventory items will equip them or use them (in the case of consumables).
- **Kill Command**: button **K** to order attacks.
- **Scriptable Scriptures**: button **B** to switch between open and closed scriptures.
- **Security Enhanced**: buttons **O** and **P** to equip lockpicks and probes respectively.

Congratulations, your modded Morrowind installation is ready!
