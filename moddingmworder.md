## MODDING MORROWIND ASSET CONFLICTS

Because the base **Mending Morrowind** guide includes many bug fixes and optimizations for vanilla Morrowind content, there are many unavoidable conflicts present with mods included in **Modding Morrowind**.

That said, there are a number of mods present in **Modding Morrowind** that are meant to be installed in a given order to ensure their patches are working as intended.

- **GH Patches and Replacers** needs to be loaded after both **Correct UV Ore Replacer** and **Graphic Herbalism MWSE**.
- **Project Atlas - Glow in the Dahrk Patch** needs to be loaded after **Glow in the Dahrk**.
- **Weapon Sheathing - Bow Position Edit** and **Morrowind Optimization Patch - Weapon Sheathing Patch** need to be loaded after **Weapon Sheathing**.
- **MWSEabotlib** needs to be loaded after any of **abot**'s mods.

## MODDING MORROWIND PLUGIN CONFLICTS

Because the base **Mending Morrowind** guide includes many bug fixes for vanilla Morrowind content, there are many unavoidable conflicts present with mods included in **Modding Morrowind**.

That said, there are a number of plugins present in **Modding Morrowind** that are meant to be loaded in a given order to ensure they are working with the least amount of conflicts possible.

- Ownership Overhaul.esp
  - Load it just after **Mending Morrowind**'s mods so as to prevent it from overwriting crucial changes made by mods installed in **Modding Morrowind**.

>This will ensure Ownership Overhaul doesn't override crucial changes made by these mods to certain containers.

- Realistic_Repair_Add-on.ESP
  - Load before **Realistic_Repair_Add-on - Patch for Purists Patch.ESP**

>This will ensure the patch works as intended.
