## MODDING MORROWIND ASSET CONFLICTS

Because the base **Mending Morrowind** guide includes many bug fixes and optimizations for vanilla Morrowind content, there are many unavoidable conflicts present with mods included in **Modding Morrowind**.

That said, there are a number of mods present in **Modding Morrowind** that are meant to be installed in a given order to ensure their patches are working as intended.

- **GH Patches and Replacers** needs to be loaded after both **Correct UV Ore Replacer** and **Graphic Herbalism MWSE**.
- **Project Atlas - Glow in the Dahrk Patch** needs to be loaded after **Glow in the Dahrk**.
- **Switchable Scriptures** needs to be loaded after both **Morrowind Optimization Patch** and **Melchior's Magnificent Manuscripts**.
- **Weapon Sheathing - Bow Position Edit** and **Morrowind Optimization Patch - Weapon Sheathing Patch** need to be loaded after **Weapon Sheathing**.
- **Seven Graces Shrines Enhanced - No Script Edits** and **Seven Graces Shrines Enhanced - Simple Golden Gold Patch** need to be loaded after **Seven Graces Shrines Enhanced**.
- **MWSEabotlib** needs to be loaded after any of **abot**'s mods.

>This will ensure these patches work as intended.
