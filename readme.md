## DESCRIPTION

**Morrowind++** is the result of years of five years of modding Morrowind, looking up guides, installing mods, troubleshooting, and engaging with other users (modders and end users alike). It's a modding guide that aims to enhance Morrowind across the board, based on the following pillars:

- Performance and stability: with the exception of the optional MGE XE shaders, your game should perform better than vanilla, and crash considerably less. I can report less than a couple of crashes in hundreds of gameplay hours.
- Faithfulness: mods suggested here will not turn Morrowind into an unrecognizable game. Unique gameplay elements and Morrowind's distinctive aesthetic won't be sacrificed in favor of "modernity". Everything that is suggested will simply improve on what's already there, blending in seamlessly with the vanilla game.
- Compatibility: mod conflicts will be kept to a minimum in order to ensure all of them work as intended.

## THE GUIDE

This guide is divided in three sections:

- The [Setup](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#setup) guide, which explains how to get the game running, set up the tools and mod manager we'll be using to mod Morrowind.
- The [Morrowind++](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++.md#morrowind) guide, designed to experience a modernized Morrowind without introducing radically new gameplay mechanics or content, or modding Morrowind's aesthetics beyond the point of being unrecognizable.
- The [Tools](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tools) guide, which goes deep into using the tools installed in Setup in order  to solve potential issues with the mods installed in Morrowind++.

**Morrowind++** is divided into a series of modules, all of which can be installed independently from one another. The **Core** module, however, should be great for anyone willing to iron out the many issues plaguing vanilla Morrowind.

All mods present in Morrowind++ will have a brief description on what they do, as well as the appropiate link to their mod pages (almost always on Nexus, rarely on Morrowind Modding History, and under very specific circumstances on my personal MediaFire).

At the end of Morrowind++ you will find a link to the mod order and load order, allowing you to check whether you have installed the mods as intended.

## CONSIDERATIONS

There are a few things you may want to keep in mind before going through with this guide.

- Morrowind++ consists of roughly 160 mods and 70 new plugins. You can always pick and choose what you'd like to install if this sounds too daunting to you.
- The total size of the guide is short of 5GB (the standard Morrowind installation, which we will keep clean, adds another 1.5GB). This accounts for installed mods and also their original compressed files.
- The mod manager this guide uses is **Mod Organizer 2**. The **Setup** module will explain in detail why, and how to use it.
- This guide is not designed with **OpenMW** or **Morrowind Rebirth** in mind. This guide makes heavy use of the features of the Morrowind Script Extender, incompatible with OpenMW, and many of the mods present in this guide will conflict with the Morrowind Rebirth overhaul. You have been warned.
- This guide does not contemplate **Tamriel Rebuilt**: though compatibility with the mod itself is very good, Tamriel Rebuilt content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods suggested here.

## MY SETUP

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in Vivec City and the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors). For reference, here is a my setup.

- OS: Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit
- CPU: Intel Core i5 4440
- RAM: 8GB
- Graphics: 1GB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series
- HDD: 1TB
