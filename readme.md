## Description

**Morrowind++** is the result of five years of playing Morrowind, looking up modding guides, installing mods, troubleshooting them, and engaging with other users (modders and end users alike). It's a modding guide that aims to enhance Morrowind across the board, based on the following pillars:

- Performance and stability: with the exception of the optional MGE XE shaders, your game should perform better than vanilla, and crash considerably less. I can report less than a couple of crashes in hundreds of gameplay hours.
- Faithfulness: mods suggested here will not turn Morrowind into an unrecognizable game. Unique gameplay elements and Morrowind's distinctive aesthetic won't be sacrificed in favor of "modernity". Everything that is suggested will simply improve on what's already there, blending in seamlessly with the vanilla game.
- Compatibility: mod conflicts will be kept to a minimum in order to ensure all of them work as intended.

**Morrowind++** is divided in three sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#setup), which explains how to get the game running, set up the tools and mod manager we'll be using to mod Morrowind. It's in its own section since it is quite draining.
- [**Morrowind++**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++.md#morrowind), which contains the mods we will be actually installing. This is a beginner-friendly guide that keeps the game's aesthetic and gameplay nearly intact.
- [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tools), which contains instructions to use the tools installed in **Setup**, and which you will referred to from **Morrowind++** only when necessary. Feel free to browse this on your own, however.

The **Morrowind++** page is divided into a series of modules, all of which can be installed independently from one another. The **Core** module contains bug fixes, high resolution textures using AI upscaling, and a couple of mods addressing the implementation of expansions to iron out the Morrowind experience. It's a good recommendation for anyone looking to play Morrowind for the first time.

All mods present in Morrowind++ will have a brief description on what they do, as well as the appropiate link to their mod pages (almost always on Nexus, rarely on Morrowind Modding History, and under very specific circumstances on Google Drive or my personal MediaFire folder).

At the end of Morrowind++ you will find the install order and load order of the mods present in the guide. Following this order is very important to ensure mods work as intended.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods in this guide rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. This guide changes many aspects of the game which will be incompatible with Morrowind Rebirth. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Though compatibility with Tamriel Rebuilt itself is very good, Tamriel Rebuilt content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods suggested here, such as visual or gameplay improvements.

### How many plugins and mods are there?

Morrowind++ consists of roughly 70 mods and 20 new plugins. You can always pick and choose what you'd like to install if this sounds too daunting to you. Very, very few mods depend on others to work as intended. Those that do are clearly pointed out in the guide. Working on this mod list, it was very important for me to keep the amount of mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 4GB. This accounts for installed (that is, uncompressed) mods and also their original installation files, which I recommend keeping just in case you need to reinstall them.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

It depends!

Setting up the game tools (**Setup**) is a very boring process: you are installing stuff you will need in the future, but not any fun mods. **Morrowind++** is a long guide, but thankfully you can simply focus on the **Core** and **Gameplay** modules if you want to jump into the game as soon as possible, with **Yet Another Guard Diversity** (under Visuals) being the *only* other mod you should install before beginning a new playthrough. The entirety of this process should last you no longer than an hour and a half, allowing you to enjoy Morrowind and install the other mods in the guide when you feel like it.

Bottomline is, it will take you far less time to install **Morrowind++** than setting up most other Morrowind guides, bar the most spartan ones.
