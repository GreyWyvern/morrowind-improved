## DESCRIPTION

**Morrowind++** is the result of years of five years of modding Morrowind, looking up guides, installing mods, troubleshooting, and engaging with other users (modders and end users alike). It's a modding guide that aims to enhance Morrowind across the board, based on the following pillars:

- Performance and stability: with the exception of the optional MGE XE shaders, your game should perform better than vanilla, and crash considerably less. I can report less than a couple of crashes in hundreds of gameplay hours.
- Faithfulness: mods suggested here will not turn Morrowind into an unrecognizable game. Unique gameplay elements and Morrowind's distinctive aesthetic won't be sacrificed in favor of "modernity". Everything that is suggested will simply improve on what's already there, blending in seamlessly with the vanilla game.
- Compatibility: mod conflicts will be kept to a minimum in order to ensure all of them work as intended.

## THE GUIDE

**Morrowind++** is divided in three sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#setup), which explains how to get the game running, set up the tools and mod manager we'll be using to mod Morrowind. It's in its own section since it is quite draining.
- [**Morrowind++**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++.md#morrowind), which contains the actual mods we will be installing to experience an improved Morrowind experience, ithout introducing radically new gameplay mechanics, content, or changing Morrowind's aesthetics beyond being recognizable anymore.
- [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tools), which contains instructions to use the tools installed in **Setup**, and which you will referred to from **Morrowind++** only when necessary. Feel free to browse this on your own, however.

The **Morrowind++** page is divided into a series of modules, all of which can be installed independently from one another. The **Core** module contains bug fixes, high resolution textures using AI upscaling, and a bunch of quality of life improvements meant to iron out the Morrowind experience. It's a good recommendation for anyone looking to play Morrowind.

All mods present in Morrowind++ will have a brief description on what they do, as well as the appropiate link to their mod pages (almost always on Nexus, rarely on Morrowind Modding History, and under very specific circumstances on my personal MediaFire or Google Drive).

At the end of Morrowind++ you will find a link to the [**mod order and load order**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++order.md#morrowind) of the mods installed in the guide. Following this order is very important to ensure mods work as intended.

## FAQ

### How many plugins and mods are there?

Morrowind++ consists of roughly 140 mods and 60 new plugins. You can always pick and choose what you'd like to install if this sounds too daunting to you. Very, very few mods depend on others to work as intended. Those that do are clearly pointed out in the guide. Working on this mod list, it was very important for me to keep the amount of mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 5GB. This accounts for installed (that is, uncompressed) mods and also their original installation files, which I recommend keeping just in case you need to reinstall them.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

My recommendation is that you follow the **Setup** and **Morrowind++** guides on separate days. Setting up the game and tools is a very boring process: you are installing stuff you will need in the future, but not any fun mods. **Morrowind++** is a long guide, but most people won't bother installing all mods in it. Overall, I can't give you a number. I can tell you, however, it will take you far less time than setting up most other Morrowind guides, bar the most spartan ones.

### Should I manually install these mods?

This guide recommends the use of **Mod Organizer 2** for installing mods. The **Setup** guide will explain in detail why, and how to make the best of this mod manager.

### Why isn't (particular mod) included in the guide?

There can be many reasons for this, but I'll start with the most important: Morrowind++ consists of mods I personally play with. Because of this, I feel comfortable recommending them (i.e. listing them here). No matter how good a mod may be, if I personally don't use it, it won't be featured in Morrowind++.

As to what makes me not use a mod:

- The mod, I feel, isn't worth the time that goes into installing it. When your modding guide consists of 100+ mods, trying to keep it short is key.
- The mod adds "original content" to the game, such as NPCs, quests, etc. I don't feel comfortable with that sort of content.
- The mod stands out too much from the vanilla game. Even mods that utilize vanilla assets can stand out (for instance, by adding lots of clutter in a game notorious for its sparse use of clutter).
- The mod conflicts with many mods present in the guide.
- The mod is very performance intensive.

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods in this guide rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. This guide changes many aspects of the game which will be incompatible with Morrowind Rebirth. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Though compatibility with Tamriel Rebuilt itself is very good, Tamriel Rebuilt content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods suggested here, such as visual or gameplay improvements.

## MY SETUP
